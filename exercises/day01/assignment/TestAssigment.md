# Test Assignment

This is an example of an assignment for the `Modern C++` course. It is based on C++98 because it will be discussed before much of modern C++ is shown.



## Exercise

Implement two classes which behave respectively as a printer client and a printer server. 

The client accepts a string and sends it to a specific printer server which sends it to standard output. The interface of the two classes will be minimal and will hide implementation using the PIMPL idiom.

The project will use CMake, must compile and when launched must produce the print of the following sequence of strings: "hello", "world", "of", "example", "test", "assignment". 

You will write a brief explanation of the project using Markdown language.

The project will be written in plain old C++98.
